# Syntax Highlighting for Sass
This is a new syntax highlighting package for Sass (both SCSS and Sass syntaxes) for Sublime Text. Compared with other packages, this will match the structure of `property name` and `property value` instead of matching keywords (actually nothing will match `property name`, it will be treated as basic Sass text), so those two parts will be perfectly highlighted. Also added support for attribute selector, variables, interpolation syntax, directives and directive shorthand (`=` `+`), build-in functionsâ€¦ etc. And also  improved the highlighting rule for `@media`.

The Preferences and Completions two folders are directly copied from [nathos's sass-textmate-bundle](https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle/tree/sublime) with a little bit of modifications. In this package the `property-name.sass` scope selector is only used to fix keyword conflict, so the `Sass - Properties.sublime-completions` file is removed.

I have shared a custom `Solarized (Light).tmTheme` in Color Scheme folder, so you can see how this highlighting package works. And you can also build your own colour scheme with the following scope selectors. (Learn more about Scope Selectors and Color Scheme, you can have a look at [Textmate Scope Selectors](http://manual.macromates.com/en/scope_selectors) and [Textmate Themes](http://manual.macromates.com/en/themes.html).)

As always, if you have any problems with this package or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to [fill an issue](https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass/issues/new), and you are also more than welcome to fork this repo and pull request.
